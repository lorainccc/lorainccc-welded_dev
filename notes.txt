Full Banner (content-banner.php)
    As of now this element is used on the Home and Workshops Page
    It is a full width banner with css background image and a text box overlay
    The class name is 'banner-full'
    The background image is set by the Featured Image of the post
    The overlaid text content is managed in the 'banner-text' custom field, managed on the edit page in wordpress. Use markup in the custom-field value and style with css.

    Ask Joe to help implement or if there is documentation I can follow.
    Using Mobile Menu plug is for now.
