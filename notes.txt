Full Banner (content-banner.php)
    As of now this element is used on the Home and Workshops Page
    It is a full width banner with css background image and a text box overlay
    the class name is 'banner-full'
    the background image is set by the Featured Image of the post
    the overlaid text content is managed in the 'banner-text' custom field, managed on the edit page in wordpress. Use markup in the custom-field value and style with css.

Mobile menu
    LCCC code in /js/funcitons.js
    Ask Joe to help implement or if there is documentation I can follow.

Accessibility

Audit #1 - 02-27-2022
Search icon in header__widgts area:
needs role=button and aria-label="search"
Widget is created in Wordpress editor. Don't see a way to add tags.
Is there a way to do it in the register?

Redundant alt tags on Logo

Punch list
-------------
1. Uniform button text color, text hover, text visited
2. Switch out page banners
3. Mobile menu
4. And leftover responsive issues after mobile menu is in place
5. Images for underrepresented, workshops and fabtech
